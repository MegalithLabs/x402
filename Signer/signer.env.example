## RECIPIENT
# 0x... Recipient address (who receives the tokens)

## TOKEN
# 0x... Token contract address (the ERC-20 or EIP-3009 token to send)

## AMOUNT
# Amount to send (in natural units; signer.js handles the token's decimals)
# Example: "1.5" sends 1.5 tokens, 

## STARGATE_CONTRACT
# Leave empty to automatically fetch latest version from API (recommended)
# Or manually override with specific address: 0x...
# Only needed for standard ERC-20 tokens (not EIP-3009)
# Check x402.megalithlabs.ai/contracts for latest versions

# ================ Examples
#
# NETWORK= 56
# PAYER_KEY= 0x...
# RECIPIENT= 0x...
# TOKEN= 0x...
# AMOUNT= 10.5
# STARGATE_CONTRACT=


# ================ Notes
# - The script auto-detects if the token is EIP-3009 or standard ERC-20
# - For EIP-3009 tokens:
#   - STARGATE_CONTRACT is not needed
#   - No token approval required
# - For standard ERC-20 tokens:
#   - STARGATE_CONTRACT auto-fetched from API if left empty (recommended)
#   - Token approval required: run "npm run approve" first
#   - STARGATE_CONTRACT must have approval to spend TOKEN on behalf of sender
